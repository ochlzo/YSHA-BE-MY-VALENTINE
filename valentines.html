                <p>Labb, before you give me your answer, I just wanna say a few things. </p>
                <p>Ysha, mybaby... This is my first time asking someone to be my valentine, and I'm very greatful to have the opportunity to ask you. It doesn't matter if you're my girlfriend na because I still have to win your heart eh hehe. And Imma take this opportunity to ask you before mag start ang February.</p> 
                <p>Labb, I love you so much and I want you to know that everyday. Even on days that you feel like I don't, because I do, always. And probably will FOREVER. We may argue, disagree, misundertsand each other and have breakups, but I know you know naman na lahat nang yan hindi makakatinag sa pagmamahal ko sayo, bleh. Alam mo naman na kung pano ako humagulgol sayo eh, buhay ng gangstaa~ and I believe that those things, especially the bad things that happen here in our relationship, is what brings us closer and deepens our bond. Because I believe in the quote "What comes easy, won't last long, and what lasts long, won't come easy". Althoouughhh, I know that you get tired, drained, and feel that this relationship isn't for you, but I want you think about the good things we have and share, how we support eachother and how we make eachother laugh. Because love for me is the kind of love that never gives up, the kind of love that chooses to stay in love, and we have that going up until now. So I won't just ask you labb to celebrate valentine's with me, I want to celebrate our love, that keeps us close, makes us happy, and fills our hearts.</p> 
                <p>So can you please be my valentine?</p>
